# Dominos

This project is to create a simple domino solver that I can use in family game night

## Why?

The real reason behind this project is to further my understanding of testing, auto-documenation, and CI tools.

For the whole project I am adopting the style of test driven development to become more familiar with the style.
By using this style it should also help me develop an intuitive understanding if a function i've written is easily testable

I also wanted to try out Doxygen again for auto-documentation in order to create a nicely documented project.

Lastly, I wanted to bundle this all together with github actions to create something with automatic testing, auto generation of documenation, and code coverage all automatically on every push. Ideally I can have the documentation become part of the wiki as well.
